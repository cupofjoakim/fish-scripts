# fish scripts
A small collection of fish scripts that I've been using to help out with some common issues I run into.

## Usage
All of these scripts follow the same usage pattern and requires [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) to be installed.

1. Make the script runnable: `chmod +x ./<script name>.fish`
2. Run the script with an optional path as the argument: `./<script name>.fish /some-route`
